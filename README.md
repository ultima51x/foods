# Foods

I'm trying to learn Node.js and TypeScript by implementing a simple CRUD API.

My hope is this could be used as a really simple template for future projects.

This will be a simple recipe list API.

Node.js 10 supports ES2018 features, so I'm targeting 2018.

## Proposed Data Model

* Recipe
* Ingredients
* Attachments (screenshots, etc.)

## Possible Features

* process.env to have a typescript type
* CRUD
* Search
* Attach Images and PDFs to Recipes

## Common Tasks

### Development

```sh
yarn run watch
```

### Database Stuff

For available commands, check out:

```sh
yarn sequelize
```

### Debugging

In VSCode, attach using the command: "Debug: Attach to Node Process"
